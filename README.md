## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** Ruby, RSpec

### How to play:
* Saving / loading
* Castling: 

### Lessons Learned:
* Learn how ANSI escape codes interacts with terminal for color
* ASCII for numbers
* Create advanced command line game
* Breaking game down into parts or logical steps/ structured approach to writing by thinking logically and staying organized
* pseudocoding
* Applying cumulative experience from past projects Eg. caesar cipher
* Implementing RSpec testing coverage to prevent repetitive command line self testing
* Importance of testing in complex projects / aiding in code recall
* Importance of method chaining and code reusability


### further optimizations / rules
* Adding more draw criteria (Threefold repetition, Fifty-move rule, dead positions)
* simplify logic to less methods
* more advanced AI, recursion, breadth first search for min max
flipping board
* Reducing redundant code for black and white pieces
* Further modularize code
* Pawn promotion prompt, currently only promotes to Queen
* En passant
