## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** Ruby, RSpec

### Lessons Learned:
* Learn how ANSI escape codes interacts with terminal for color
* Create advanced command line game
* Breaking code down into parts
* Applying cumulative experience from past projects Eg. caesar cipher
* Implementing RSpec testing coverage to prevent repetitive command line self testing
* Importance of testing in complex projects / aiding in code recall







### further optimizations / rules
Adding more draw criteria (Threefold repetition, Fifty-move rule, dead positions)
simplify logic to less methods
more advanced AI, recursion, breadth first search for min max
flipping board
